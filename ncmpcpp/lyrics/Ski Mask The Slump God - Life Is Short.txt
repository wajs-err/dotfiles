Life's short smoke a port on a port (on a port)
In New York calculating like a dork
Kill Bill, tracksuit, 'preme shorts
Life's short what it's worth, wrist work
Life's short smoke a port on a port (on a port)
In New York calculating like a dork, bitch
Kill Bill, tracksuit, 'preme shorts
Life's short what it's worth, wrist work

I, can't, pocket an L from my enemy
You, won't, suck up or fuck up my energy
Chef, boyardee, bitch I'm whippin up sauce, ya see
Down, to the, bullshit you talking the jealousy
Ice cubes on a nigga neck like is we there yet
Mac, turn your guts to macaroni wet(tec!)
Good pussy sound like macaroni best wet
Never let another nigga try yo set
Wanna be the best don't hold your breathe
Looking at my garments and they stripped like ness
