Uh, turn, what goes around comes around
Ayy, turn, turn the music up, uh, yeah
Goes around comes around
What goes, alright, like like
Life goes in cycles
Everything that comes around goes around
'Fore it goes down, get you some ice

Life goes in cycles, what comes around goes around
So 'fore it goes down, nigga, get you some icicles
Audemars before all of y'alls
Wristwatch got a Russian face like an oligarch, uh
12 o'clock, boy, silly nice, huh
Willie in traffic, I'm Philly nice, uh
E.T. on the handles, uh
Handlebars like a Xanax
Shammgod with the AND1 moves
Throw that shit 'round your neck
Right quick, broke boys get fixed
Right quick, Nigel Sylvester with these bike flips
Uh, that's a full cab and a back flip
Uh, sidebar

Arm stretch a tee like I nailed it
Raf moving slow like a creep
Shirt in the breeze like I'm sailing
And I walk in my sleep, I can't help that (I can't)
When's the last time I asked for some help that
I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?
I couldn't get from nobody out there (I can't)
When's the last time I asked for some help that
I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?
Nobody

I don't get weak in the knees
Hundreds spread out like a fan
Vert feel like some Gucci sandals
Open the sky, get a handful
Torso marked up like a vandal
How you not fucking with cash?
God gave you what you could handle
Gave you what you could handle
I got the grip like the handle
And I'm biking
I'm biking with me and my Daniel
Hades got the angels
TV's got the angles
I'm braking... got

Biking, I'm biking, I'm biking slow-mo
Maybe the four wheel exciting us mo'
I'm cold when the temperatures dip below 70s
How can I be burr around L.A. coast?
The diamonds is plural, the Tiffany brooch
On my lapel, at the table, I'm giving a toast
The first wedding that I've been in my twenties
Thinking maybe someone is not something to own
Maybe the government got nothing to do with it
Thinking maybe the feeling just comes and it goes
Think I want me a little one that look like my clone
Me and my baby can't do on our own
I landed a trick, got my impossibles
I'm fucking with Addy, I'm watching my dose
24 hours like they never close
I'm biking, I'm biking, I'm biking these blocks, yeah
Since Ben Baller sold all his ice up at Slauson, ooh
I'm biking uphill and it's burning my quads (Obstacles)
I'm biking downhill and it sound like a fishing rod
Savage, I'm biking, yeah

From Coldwater to the Shaw
Alcoholic way I handle the bars
This a PK, PK Ripper
Nah, you can't fuck with the boy
That's my problem, yeah, I got 'em
My tire smoking when I stop
Okay, nobody fucking with me
My accolades hang from my neck
Pedal, I drown in the heat
My sapphires drown in my sweat
White mags, but I jet
Jackson, I'm saving the streets
I'm Roger Rabbit in the air
I don't care, Big Willie Style, yeah
Nigga one wheel, one wheel, one wheel
Nigga one wheel, I fishtail downhill, yeah
I rose my rate, brand new brakes
Why I name it Slater? Ask my date

I don't get weak in the knees
Hundreds spread out like a fan
Vert feel like some Gucci sandals
Open the sky, get a handful
Torso marked up like a vandal
How you not fucking with cash?
God gave you what you could handle
Gave you what you could handle
I got the grip like the handle
And I'm biking
I'm biking with me and my Daniel
Hades got the angels
TV's got the angles
I'm braking

Got, got me fucked up
Got a million dollar bike
Got a million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up
Got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up

Million dollar bike
