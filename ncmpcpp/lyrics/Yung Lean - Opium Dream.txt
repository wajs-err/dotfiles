[Bladee:]
In the same place, stuck, stuck
In the same place, stuck, stuck
Off the-off the next day, dread, dread (Dread)
Within a new phase (Dread), head (Dread), space (Dread)

In a black hole (Stuck), dark (Stuck), dark (Stuck)
Night of the soul (Stuck, stuck), dark, dark
Disarray (Ah, ah), disarray (Ah, ah)
Disarray (Ah, ah), dissociate (Ah, ah)

[Yung Lean:]
Opium dreams (You're my desire)
Opium dreams (Layin' next to you)
Opium dreams (You're my desire)
Opium (Next to you)

[Bladee:]
Black clouds I see
Rain shame on me
Blamed and guilty
Stained and filthy
You, just you

In the same place (You), stuck, stuck
In the same place (Ooh), stuck, stuck
Off the next day (Ooh), dread, dread
Within a new phase (Ooh), head space

[Yung Lean:]
Opium dreams (You're my desire)
Opium dreams (Layin' next to you)
Opium dreams (You're my desire)
Opium (Next to you)
Opium dreams
Opium dreams
Opium dreams
Opium (Layin' next to you)
