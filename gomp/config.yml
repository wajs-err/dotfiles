MPD_PORT : "6600"
  # Port on which music player daemon is running
  # Do not provide this if you are connecting through a unix socket

NETWORK_TYPE : "tcp" # Defaults to tcp if not provided, use "unix"
  # if MPD Server is configured to expose
  # a unix socket rather than a port
  # Known networks are "tcp", "tcp4" (IPv4-only), "tcp6" (IPv6-only), "udp",
  # "udp4" (IPv4-only), "udp6" (IPv6-only),
  # "ip", "ip4" (IPv4-only), "ip6" (IPv6-only), "unix" and "unixpacket".

NETWORK_ADDRESS : "localhost" # Defaults to localhost if not provided,
  # This is the address of the host,
  # for e.g "localhost"/ "127.0.0.1" / a Unix Socket "~/.mpd/socket"

SEEK_OFFSET : 1
# The amount of seconds by which the song should seek forward or backward
# Defaults to 1 if not provided

GET_COVER_ART_FROM_LAST_FM : "TRUE" # Turn On Getting Album art from lastfm api
LASTFM_API_KEY: "YOUR API KEY HERE"
LASTFM_API_SECRET: "YOUR API SECRET HERE"
LASTFM_AUTO_CORRECT: 1  # 0 means it is turned off
  # according to lastfm documentation
  # autocorrect[0|1] (Optional) : Transform misspelled artist names into
  # correct artist names, returning the correct version instead.

# Mappings
#
# Mapping works in the following way:
# Function: [ firstMapping, secondMapping, thirdMapping, ...... ]
# for e.g
togglePlayBack : [ "p", "SPACE", "]" ] # using the quotes is neccessary.
  # all the three keys now have the same function.
  # To see Availabe Keys and Functions :

# Caching
#
# The Covert arts that are extracted from the file or downloaded from lastfm
# are cached. It Is neccessary to define a cache directory to store all
# the cover arts. The Caching works as follows
# 1. Check if there is an embedded cover art if not then 2
# 2. Check if lastfm has album art if not then 3
# 3. Fallback to the default image.
#
#
CACHE_DIR : "~/.confog/gomp/cache"
  # for e.g "~/.config/gomp/cache/"
  # You will have to manually create this directory.
